<h1>Design Bias</h1>

<h2>Prologue</h2>

<header>Design Bias is an interactive parallax website. It aims to use parallax web design for the storytelling and education of implicit AI bias that affects millennials & gen z age groups. Design Bias aims To inspire future designers and users to think about their technology with an acute awareness of their effects. “Unfortunately, we have biases that live in our data, and if we don’t acknowledge that and if we don’t take specific actions to address it then we’re just going to continue to perpetuate them or even make them worse.” — Kathy Baxter, Ethical AI Practice Architect, Salesforce.</header>

    <p>What is AI implicit Bias?</p>
  </figure>
  
  <article>
    <p>Implicit bias is discrimination or prejudice against a person or group that is unconscious to the person with the bias. It is dangerous because the person is unaware of the bias – whether it be on grounds of gender, race, disability, sexuality or class.</p>
    
    <p>
Both conscious and unconscious biases often creep into the recruiting process, resulting in the rejection of deserving candidates. Artificial intelligence (AI) is often credited for mitigating bias in hiring as the technology screens candidates using a large volume of data.</p>
    
    <p>Although nobody knows what percentage of applicants get audited by the PMI, many experts have guessed it is around 5-10%.</p>

    <p>Hello, my name is AI. My job as an AI program is to make automation easier for humans to search for new job applicants.</p>
    
    <p>Since my creation recruiters are increasingly using AI to make the first round of cuts and to determine whether a job posting is even advertised to you. </p>
    
    <p>Up to 67 percent of hiring managers and recruiters surveyed by LinkedIn said AI was saving them time.</p>

    <p>Hello, I am User. Does this mean that finding a job will be harder?</p>
    
    <p>Without human eyes my resume can get overlooked by you?</p>

    <p>Critics argue that such systems can introduce bias, lack accountability and transparency, and aren’t guaranteed to be accurate.</p>
    
    <p>AI for recruiting is the application of artificial intelligence to the talent acquisition process, where machine learning can learn to shortlist your ideal candidate, as well as automate manual tasks in the recruitment process.</p>
    
    <p>The computers are now the gatekeepers of the jobs in a sense. They have the power to reject or accept applications.</p>

    <p>In 2020, there was 4.2 billion digital voice assistance in use worldwide. Digital assistant usage worldwide is expected to double to 8.4 billion by 2024. The most prominent use case for AI in the retail industry is customer engagement (chatbots, predictive behavior analysis, hyper-personalization).</p>
    
    <p>The global AI market is predicted to snowball in the next few years, reaching a $190.61 billion market value in 2025.</p>

<h2>Why does this pose a threat for job seekers?</h2>

    <p>A resume can only give information about someone's hard skills, but research and common sense tells us that it's also soft skills that contribute to job succes.</p>

 <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is often credited for mitigating bias in hiring as the technology screens candidates using a large volume of data. AI, using its algorithm, combines various data points and predicts the best-fit candidate for a role. The human brain obviously can’t process information at such a massive scale. AI objectively assesses the data points and reduces assumptions, mental fatigue and bias that humans often succumb to.</p>

 <p>De-coding bias in their program has been key for companies recently. Companies such as IBM, and Microsoft have made public commitments to “de-bias” their profile. In this study, the authors questioned if AI systems are the problem? Can we solve it with AI coding? Terms such as Statistical and Social Bias were coined in this discussion about medical bias. Statistical bias means that an algorithm that produces a result that differs from the underlying estimate. Which will affect different groups of individuals. Social Bias in health care leads to certain groups being underserved in a set community. Social bias could be based on data or by a human being. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are limited by data that is fed by a coder. The data is passed on population, race, gender, etc. When applied correctly artificial intelligence can improve our lives. AI systems can be also used to correct the bias in code.</p>

    <p>More Than 60% of Job Seekers Unsure if Companies Use Artificial Intelligence to Review Applications.</p>
    
    <p>17% of companies use AI-based solutions in their HR function and another 30% will do so by 2022, according to the Gartner 2019 Artificial Intelligence Survey.</p>
    
    <p>Recruitment AI devolpers have claimed that AIs will speed up the recruitment process and make it more accurate.
Soon it will be a standard, mainly because there is a high demand from the recruiters themselves.</p>

    <p>Based on a report released in 2021. 27 million "hidden workers" in the US are being filtered out of job applications by automated tech, a report by Harvard Business School and Accenture says. Their skills are regularly overlooked by the AI-driven hiring practices many employers rely on.</p>
    
    <p>Things that you can do to midigate Bias during job hunting. 

<ol type='1'>
    <li>
        <p>Keep your resume's format simple.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Understand keywords being used to rank canidates for the position</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Lastly, once you get passed the AI you have to impress the human recruiters.</p>
